                                                - Better update-routine tho the script ....
                                                  
                                                 I made a little failure to run git pull  ....
                                                 We should run it this way .... the corect way
                                                 
                                                 git reset --hard origin/master 
                                                 git pull https://github.com/swtor00/swtor-addon-to-tails
               
						 If the the directory /home/amnesia/.ssh is found empty on 
                                                 startup of selector.sh we exit the script immediately. 
                                                 In this case we assume, that this tails system never
                                                 contacted any ssh-host.

						 Adding 2 more options inside swtor.cfg

                                                 Your backup will be very big ....
                                                 You need at least 180 mb to store
                                                 all data. All the data inside 
                                                 ~/Persistent/personal-files will be backuped,

                                                 be made, if it is the wish of the user
                                                 backup-files can be transferd to a backup-host

                                                  If DOTFILES are activated with the persistent volume, you 
                                                  never have to make this settings again.In this release of the 
                                                  addon the Wallpaper made is also persistent.

						- I had a incidence with github and ssh. Someone tried a VERY bad thing 
                                                  with me.Someone tried a little "man in the middle attack" with me.
                                                  I was allready using ssh for "git push" so I saw the key-change. 
                                                    
                                                  https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints


                                                - I have rewritten most of the code of all shell-scripts. 
                                                  By now I have over 100 commits made. 

                                                - After a weekend full of shell-scripting I am almost finished.

                                                - If you type the password wrong or empty ... you have other 2 chances 
                                                  to correct it.After 3 x times wrong or empty, the script aborts. 
                                             
                                                - The ssh login used is not longer shown inside the sss-servermenu.But instead
                                                  of the login-name you see the content of the backup field.

                                                - It is now not longer possible to exit the script swtor-menu.sh as long there 
                                                  is a connected Server. You have to close the connection and you can 
                                                  exit the script.

                                                - I found a way to display a message "please wait" with zenity during long operations
                                                  of the script. This wish was a very long pending item on my personal$  
                                                  wishlist. Without the command "pkill -15  -P$pid > /dev/null" I filled 
                                                  the process table with orphaned pwait1.sh processes. 

                                                - Inside setup.sh the checking for a previous execution of the script has moved 
                                                  to the top.  

                                                - Added the following 3 new addon options:

                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:YES
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:NO                                                  
                                                  TIMEOUT-SSH:4
 
                                                  Both default values for the next 2 options 

                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:YES
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:NO  
                                                  
                                                  Alows us a faster initialisation.If you change the 
                                                  values to
                                                  
                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:NO
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:YES
                                                  
                                                  The first initialisation takes much longer with this 
                                                  values provided.    
                                                 
                                                - If there is a active connection you can't connect again
                                                  to select a SSH server from the main-menu. You have to close
                                                  the current connection first.
                                                        
                                                - Both chromium profiles are now optimized.The size is now
                                                  only 10MB. Ghostery as a addon is now disabled.The replacement 
                                                  for ghostery is the addon disconnect. A few little settings
                                                  are better now with this profiles.There is a new link in 
                                                  the bookmarks for the chromium browser 

                                                  https://www.doileak.com/classic.html
                                 
                                                  On this site , you can test mutliple settings that affect 
                                                  your privacy in general.

       
                                                - The 2 connection scripts (I guess the most used ones)
                                    
                                                  fullssh.sh
                                                  fullssh-interactive.sh 
                                         
                                                  Are rewriten from sratch. All dialogs are made new
                                                  and the new waiting screen is integrated as well.

                                                - It is not longer possible to start the browser from the 
                                                  main-menu without a active connection. And I found a strange 
                                                  behavior with a error-message. A error message should be on top 
                                                  of the screen and not be hidden by a overlapping menu.
                                                  This is fixed by now. 
     
                                                - If you don't have created a fixed profile inside personal-files 
                                                  it is not longer possible to call the fixed profile from the 
                                                  main menu. The corresponding menu entry 02 will show nothing.
 
                                                - I found a real ugly bug inside the update-modul of the addon.
                                                  I don't know how long it was in the shell-code, but I guess guthub.com
                                                  changed the way to donwload a single file long time ago.
                                                  This ugly bug is now fixed ... and the update now works.
                                                       
                                                - The auto-update function is now integrated into startup.sh 
                                                  And after a test ... the function is ok.

                                                - The create_image.sh script was rewritten from scratch. 
                                                  - The backup is protected against manipulations with a 
                                                    md5 checksum. 
                                                  - You can choose to encrypt the backup with pgp or not ... 
                                                  - If you select not to enyrpt the backup you can not 
                                                    transfer the backup to a remote host over SSH.
                                                    
                                                    Of course can you backup the not encrypted backup to 
                                                    other host by hand ... but not with the help of this addon.
                                                  
                                                  - The file restrictions on a remote host where set to 
                                                    chmod 0600 after the transfer.This was very tricky
                                                    to implement but works now.
     
                                                - There was a ugly bug in the selector script. You can 
                                                  define the same host with the same username but with a 
                                                  different port definition. This is now fixed.
                                                  By now you can write the same user and host on multiple
                                                  lines as long they use a different ports.
                                                  What you should not do !
                                                  The same host and username with the same port ! 
                                                  I don't check for same entrys on mutliple lines. 

                                                - It is not longer possible to open Tools & Utilitys as 
                                                  long there is a open connection. 

                                                - I had some issues with rsync / ssh over port 443 than the normal 
                                                  port 22. Now it works ,, but I don't know exactly why ..

                                                - Prior to version 0.60 I did not check the entry of the backup host inside 
                                                  swtorssh.cfh. If the backup entry line isn't filled with fullssh.sh and ssh-id 
                                                  the backup stops ... with a charming error message.

                                                - Added F.A.Q. to the doc section.

                                                - Changed Parameter inside swtorssh.cfg fron "NoShell" to "noshell"

                                                - Changed script pfssh-interactive.sh to new dialogs

                                                - By now, all 4 conection-modes have new dialogs.
                                    
                                                  [fullssh.sh]
                                                  [fullssh-interactive.sh]   
                                                  [chainssh.sh] 
                                                  [pfssh.sh]
                                                  
                                                - Freezing / Unfreezing over tools-menu changed and 
                                                  is working. If the dot-files are not set the entrys
                                                  freezing and unfreezing do not appear in the menu.

                                                - By now we have a running watchdog process that
                                                  shows a window if a established connection is 
                                                  disconnected.As long the addon is executed this 
                                                  process (watchdog.sh) is executed in the background.

                                                - New parameter : AUTO-CLOSE for swtor.cfg         
 
                                                - It is now possible to quit the remote X11 Xclock 
                                                  ... You see the connection disconnected window.                                                             
                                                  This was not possible prior the watchdog process.
                                                     
                                                - By mistake the chromium profile "anonmyous" did

                                                - Import of Bookmarks is not working over 
                                                  Tools Menu.Because one simple reason. 

                                                  As long you are not using the TOR-Browser 
                                                  and try to import the Bookmarks it is working 
                                                  as expected. 

                                                  But the file that contains the bookmarks is
                                                  locked for security reason as long the Tor-Browser
                                                  is open. Overwriting a active open file in use 
                                                  is allmost impossible, even for rsync. 
                                             
                                                - If you would like to import the bookmarks
                                                  there comes a warning, that all windows of 
                                                  Tor Browser has to be closed or the import 
                                                  would fail. 

                                                - Added XCLOCK-SIZE:150 inside configuration file 
                                                      
                                                  If you are running Tails with a very high resolution 
                                                  the running xclock from the remote host is to small.
                                                  Increase the value to 600 or 700 Pixels and the size 
                                                  is acceptable , even with a resolution of 4K.

                                                    - Integrate software installation from restore-script into 
                                                      setup.sh 
                                                    - Testing setup.sh on a new Tails  


                                                  - Found one little bug inside the backup and restore script.

                                                    If the pgp Window to encrypt or decrypt is open and no key 
                                                    is pressed within one minute, pgp quits with a error.

                                                    Small test with flag --verbose show this entry.

                                                    gpg: problem with the agent: Timeout
  
                                                    In the create_image.sh script there is still one directory
                                                    to be removed with rm -rf, in the case the user cancel the backup.(fixed)
 
                                                  - Timout problem with gpg and create_image.sh solved.
                                                    The dialog will be shown with zenity instead pgp. (fixed)

                                                  - If the password is entered 3 times wrong with create_image.sh,
                                                    the backup folder ~/Persistent/backup still exists. (Fixed)
                                                    
                                                  - If you are stupid enough to echo a password to a file, it 
                                                    should contain the -n option. Otherwise a newline character is added. 
                                                    Ups .. mea culpa,my fault :-(

                                                  - Unencrypted tar.gz restore testing.
 
                                                  - The file setup has now a entry with 0.
                                                    On every startup the value inside setup will 
                                                    be incremented by one. If the value is zero,
                                                    the first startup of the script takes very long
                                                    to complete. This is the simple reason. 

                                                    - We did not install all the completed software packages 
                                                      one by one. We only copy the file that describes what
                                                      additional software should be installed to the right place. 
                                                 
                                                    With this in mind ... we can show a window that this first start 
                                                    is slow and depending on your current internet speed. 
                                                    
                                                    On a very low speed usb disk , the script doesn't behave like 
                                                    it would do on USB 3. Some small fixes to meet this.

                                                    - If someone is using a other language than english ... 
                                                      freezing will not work because he hasn't a folder 
                                                      Pictures ... He may have Bilder, if he using German.
                                                      (fixed)

                                                    - The unencrypted backup is now ready for release 0.80

                                                      All I have to say is : "Fuck off Putin ... Burn in Hell !!"

                                                The above two settings prevented the running of the Addon

11/09/24	0.83		swtor00		New Release 6.X of Tails based on Debian 12 is here. 
                                             
                                                - There are no longer any icons on the Desktop
                                                  Because this handling, the script has to be started from 
                                                  persistent !!
                                                - The unsafe Browser is again in the state enabled 
                                                  (It was disabled on Release 4.X and 5.X) 
                                                  The fix was easy -> Startup-Options -> disable 
                                                - Most of the scripts from Tails 5.X seems to work
                                                  and a lot of gsettings do not longer work !
                                                - Very strange error on version 6.7 and installed software 
                                                - Installed net-tools for searching failures ....
                                                - Allmost all is working ..... Only the the big open terminal 
                                                  over the new Gnome.Desktop isn't nice to look 

12/09/24	0.83		swtor00		- Fixed Bookmarks                                                 
                                                - My ssh keys for github have been removed ... I had to replace it                                                    
                                                  (Stupid wankers !!!). Therefore I wasn't able to push the changes 
                                                  with git
                                                  
15/09/24	0.83		swtor00		- It seems that the new Debian 12 and Gnome always start a shell-script
                                                  maximized on the screen of Tails 6.x.This is not nice ... it is ugly ! 
                                                - Now the installation of software works in release 6.7 
                                                - command "tails-version" is deprecated.
                                                
17/09/24	0.83		swtor00		- To be honest I like the new Tails 6.7 but with all this new software came 
                                                  new problems. It is not longer possible to place a shell-script on the 
                                                  Desktop and to execute it .... 
						- A secure OS running with activated micro and webcam ?  
						
                                                gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.privacy disable-camera true
						gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.privacy disable-microphone true
                                                 
                                                And with this statements are both devices disabled 
                                                                                                  
19/09/24	0.83		swtor00		I found this 2 websites that also enhance Tails

						https://github.com/Tetrax-10/tails-tweaks
						https://github.com/TheGeorgeAlexander/torless-tails-terminal
						
						
						Still haven't found a nice way to start the the addon.
						
						Integrated 1 small deb file to integrate 3 entrys for the addon 
						into to the menu system of Tails 
						
						swtor-init 
						swtor-setup 
						swtor-menu
                                                


20/09/24	0.83		swtor00		I created 2 deb files to choose from. 
                                                open Terminal -> debug script -> tails-menu-00.deb 
                                                no Terminal -> tails-menu-01.deb  
                                                         
24/09/24	0.83		swtor00		It seems that there is a error inside fullssh-interactive.sh with 
                                                using Passwords.
                                                                            
						copy and paste error here ...
						25303
						25306
						there should be only one entry
						grep: 25306: No such file or directory

						Confirmed. This was a real ugly bug inside the code.
						It only showed up with fullssh-interactive.sh and a asked 
						password.
						Because I never used this password login over the last 
						multiples years, this bug was perfect hidden in the code for 
                                                years  !!
						
						Testing other connections with password as well ..
						
						Of course I found the same bug a second time.
						Fixed now.
						
						Increased the timeout value of the Watchdog-Script.
						And I forgot to redirect the error-channel 2 as well.
				
						curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9999 -m 8 https://www.googe.com  > /dev/null 2>&1						
						
26/09/24	0.83		swtor00		Very trange ssh-error 
						client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe						

						-vvv -o ServerAliveInterval=10 -C42N -p22 -D 9999
						
						This is the default connection string since multiple years.
						
						Sometime you are searching for a error inside the code ... 
						and you found a other bug.
						
27/09/24	0.83		swtor00		The error message for deactivated administrator has changed.

08/10/24	0.83		swtor00		Added the redirect feature : this is better solution 
                                                than a jump server ..... 

10/10/24	0.83		swtor00		Testing the redirect feature 
                                                A few bookmarks added 
                                                
11/10/24	0.83		swtor00		Testing autostart and freezing

12/10/24	0.83		swtor00		There is a ugly race condition between the 
                                                thread that installs additional Software and
                                                my script that also installs software. Both of 
                                                them could be run on same time on startup .... 
                                                and could produce a ugly error.  
                 
13/10/24	0.83		swtor00		Find a way to disable this race-condition, 

16/10/24	0.83		swtor00		Replaced old command tails-version with 
                                                cat /etc/os-release 
                                                The autostart code is now safe without any 
                                                any race condicion. 
                                                Found 2 ugly bugs inside the restore.script
                                                Backup and sending this file to remote host works....
                                                Restore works as well.
