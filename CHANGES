                                                - Introducing JOTV 
                                                - Better update-routine tho the script ....
                                                  
                                                 I made a little failure to run git pull  ....
                                                 We should run it this way .... the corect way
                                                 
                                                 git reset --hard origin/master 
                                                 git pull https://github.com/swtor00/swtor-addon-to-tails
               
						 If the the directory /home/amnesia/.ssh is found empty on 
                                                 startup of selector.sh we exit the script immediately. 
                                                 In this case we assume, that this tails system never
                                                 contacted any ssh-host.

						 Adding 2 more options inside swtor.cfg

                                                 If you set both values to YES .....
                                                 Your backup will be very big ....
                                                 You need at least 180 mb to store
                                                 all data. All the data inside 
                                                 ~/Persistent/personal-files will be backuped,

                                                 If you are just making a small backup with the execption of  

                                                 -fixed profile inside ~/Persistent/personal-files/3
                                                 -apt-list inside /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/apt
                                    
                                                 The generated backup will only be a 2 MB file in the size.

                                                 fixed profile inside personal-files can 
                                                 be made, if it is the wish of the user
                                                 backup-files can be transferd to a backup-host 
                                                 backup-files can be deledet on demand
