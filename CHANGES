                                                - Introducing JOTV 
                                                - Better update-routine tho the script ....
                                                  
                                                 I made a little failure to run git pull  ....
                                                 We should run it this way .... the corect way
                                                 
                                                 git reset --hard origin/master 
                                                 git pull https://github.com/swtor00/swtor-addon-to-tails
               
						 If the the directory /home/amnesia/.ssh is found empty on 
                                                 startup of selector.sh we exit the script immediately. 
                                                 In this case we assume, that this tails system never
                                                 contacted any ssh-host.

						 Adding 2 more options inside swtor.cfg

                                                 Your backup will be very big ....
                                                 You need at least 180 mb to store
                                                 all data. All the data inside 
                                                 ~/Persistent/personal-files will be backuped,

                                                 be made, if it is the wish of the user
                                                 backup-files can be transferd to a backup-host 
                                                 backup-files can be deledet on demand

                                                  after every reboot of Tails is now made with a new script.
                                                  swtor-tweak-gui.sh
                                                  If DOTFILES are activated with the persistent volume, you 
                                                  never have to make this settings again.In this release of the 
                                                  addon the Wallpaper made is also persistent.

						- I had a incidence with github and ssh. Someone tried a VERY bad thing 
                                                  with me.Someone tried a little "man in the middle attack" with me.
                                                  I was allready using ssh for "git push" so I saw the key-change.

                                                - I have rewritten most of the code of all shell-scripts. 
                                                  By now I have over 100 commits made. 

                                                - After weekend full of shell-scripting I'am allmost finished.

                                                - If you type the password wrong or empty ... you have other 2 times
                                                  to correct it.After 3 x times wrong or empty, the script aborts. 
                                             
                                                - The ssh login used is not longer shown inside the menu.But instead
                                                  of the login-name you see the content of the backup field.

                                                - It is now not longer possible to exit the script swtor-menu.sh as long there 
                                                  is a connected Server. You have to close the connection and you can 
                                                  exit the script.

                                                - I found a way to display a message "please wait" with zenity during long operations
                                                  of the script. This wish was a very long pending item on my personal$  
                                                  wishlist. Without the command "pkill -15  -P$pid > /dev/null" I filled 
                                                  the process table with orphaned pwait1.sh processes. 

                                                - Inside setup.sh the checking for a previous execution of the script has moved 
                                                  to the top.  

                                                - Added the following addon 3 options:

                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:YES
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:NO                                                  
                                                  TIMEOUT-SSH:4
 
                                                  Both default values for the next 2 options 

                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:YES
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:NO  
                                                  
                                                  alows us a faster initialisation.If you change the 
                                                  values to
                                                  
                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:NO
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:YES
                                                  
                                                  The first initialisation takes much longer with this 
                                                  values provided.    
                                                 
                                                - If there is a active connection you can't connect again
                                                  to select a SSH server from the main-menu. You have to close
                                                  the current connection first.
                                                        
                                                - Both chromium profiles are now optimized.The size is now                                                                                                                                  
                                                  only 10MB. Ghostery as a addon is now disabled.The replacement 
                                                  for ghostery is the addon disconnect. A few little settings
                                                  are better now with this profiles.There is a new link in
