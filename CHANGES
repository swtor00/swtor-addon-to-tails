                                                - Introducing JOTV 
                                                - Better update-routine tho the script ....
                                                  
                                                 I made a little failure to run git pull  ....
                                                 We should run it this way .... the corect way
                                                 
                                                 git reset --hard origin/master 
                                                 git pull https://github.com/swtor00/swtor-addon-to-tails
               
						 If the the directory /home/amnesia/.ssh is found empty on 
                                                 startup of selector.sh we exit the script immediately. 
                                                 In this case we assume, that this tails system never
                                                 contacted any ssh-host.

						 Adding 2 more options inside swtor.cfg

                                                 Your backup will be very big ....
                                                 You need at least 180 mb to store
                                                 all data. All the data inside 
                                                 ~/Persistent/personal-files will be backuped,

                                                 be made, if it is the wish of the user
                                                 backup-files can be transferd to a backup-host

                                                  If DOTFILES are activated with the persistent volume, you 
                                                  never have to make this settings again.In this release of the 
                                                  addon the Wallpaper made is also persistent.

						- I had a incidence with github and ssh. Someone tried a VERY bad thing 
                                                  with me.Someone tried a little "man in the middle attack" with me.
                                                  I was allready using ssh for "git push" so I saw the key-change. 
                                                    
                                                  https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints


                                                - I have rewritten most of the code of all shell-scripts. 
                                                  By now I have over 100 commits made. 

                                                - After a  weekend full of shell-scripting I'am allmost finished.

                                                - If you type the password wrong or empty ... you have other 2 times
                                                  to correct it.After 3 x times wrong or empty, the script aborts. 
                                             
                                                - The ssh login used is not longer shown inside the sss-servermenu.But instead
                                                  of the login-name you see the content of the backup field.

                                                - It is now not longer possible to exit the script swtor-menu.sh as long there 
                                                  is a connected Server. You have to close the connection and you can 
                                                  exit the script.

                                                - I found a way to display a message "please wait" with zenity during long operations
                                                  of the script. This wish was a very long pending item on my personal$  
                                                  wishlist. Without the command "pkill -15  -P$pid > /dev/null" I filled 
                                                  the process table with orphaned pwait1.sh processes. 

                                                - Inside setup.sh the checking for a previous execution of the script has moved 
                                                  to the top.  

                                                - Added the following 3 new addon options:

                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:YES
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:NO                                                  
                                                  TIMEOUT-SSH:4
 
                                                  Both default values for the next 2 options 

                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:YES
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:NO  
                                                  
                                                  alows us a faster initialisation.If you change the 
                                                  values to
                                                  
                                                  BYPASS-SOFTWARE-CHECK:NO
                                                  CHECK-EMPTY-SSH:YES
                                                  
                                                  The first initialisation takes much longer with this 
                                                  values provided.    
                                                 
                                                - If there is a active connection you can't connect again
                                                  to select a SSH server from the main-menu. You have to close
                                                  the current connection first.
                                                        
                                                - Both chromium profiles are now optimized.The size is now
                                                  only 10MB. Ghostery as a addon is now disabled.The replacement 
                                                  for ghostery is the addon disconnect. A few little settings
                                                  are better now with this profiles.There is a new link in 
                                                  the bookmarks for the chromium browser 

                                                  https://www.doileak.com/classic.html
                                 
                                                  On this site , you can test mutliple settings that affect 
                                                  your privacy in general.

       
                                                - The 2 connection scripts (I guess the most used ones)
                                    
                                                  fullssh.sh
                                                  fullssh-interactive.sh 
                                         
                                                  Are rewriten from sratch. All dialogs are made new
                                                  and the new waiting screen is integrated as well.

                                                - It is not longer possible to start the browser from the 
                                                  main-menu without a active connection. And I found a strange 
                                                  behavior with a error-message. A error message should be on top 
                                                  of the screen and not be hidden by a overlapping menu.
                                                  This is fixed by now. 
     
                                                - If you don't have created a fixed profile inside personal-files 
                                                  it is not longer possible to call the fixed profile form the 
                                                  main menu. The corresponding menu entry 02 will show nothing.
 
                                                - I found a real ugly bug inside the update-modul of the addon.
                                                  I don't know how long it was in the shell-code, but I guess guthub.com
                                                  changed the way to donwload a single file long time ago.
                                                  This ugly bug is now fixed ... and the update now works.
                                                       
                                                - The auto-update function is now integrated into startup.sh 
                                                  And after a test ... the function is ok.

                                                - The create_image.sh script was rewritten from scratch. 
                                                  - The backup is protected against manipulations with a 
                                                    md5 checksum. 
                                                  - You can choose to encrypt the backup with pgp or not ... 
                                                  - If you select not to enyrpt the backup you can not 
                                                    transfer the backup to a remote host over SSH.
                                                    
                                                    Of course can you backup the not encrypted backup to 
                                                    other host by hand ... but not with the help of this addon.
                                                  
                                                  - The file restrictions on a remote host where set to 
                                                    chmod 0600 after the transfer.This was very tricky
                                                    to implement but works now.
     
                                                - There was a ugly bug in the selector script. You can 
                                                  define the same host with the same username but with a 
                                                  different port definition. This is now fixed.
                                                  By now you can write the same user and host on multiple
                                                  lines as long they use a different ports.
                                                  What you should not do !
                                                  The same host and username with the same port ! 
                                                  I don't check for same entrys on mutliple lines. 

                                                - It is not longer possible to open Tools & Utilitys as 
                                                  long there is a open connection. 

                                                - I had some issues with rsync / ssh over port 443 than the normal 
                                                  port 22. Now it works ,, but I don't know exactly why ..

                                                - Prior to version 0.60 I did not check the entry of the backup host inside 
                                                  swtorssh.cfh. If the backup entry line isn't filled with fullssh.sh and ssh-id 
                                                  the backup stops ... with a charming error message.

                                                - Added F.A.Q. to the doc section.

                                                - Changed Parameter inside swtorssh.cfg fron "NoShell" to "noshell"

                                                - Changed script pfssh-interactive.sh to new dialogs

                                                - By now, all 4 conection-modes have new dialogs.
                                    
                                                  [fullssh.sh]
                                                  [fullssh-interactive.sh]   
                                                  [chainssh.sh] 
                                                  [pfssh.sh]
                                                  
                                                - Freezing / Unfreezing over tools-menu changed and 
                                                  is working. If the dot-files are not set the entrys
                                                  freezing and unfreezing do not appear in the menu.

                                                - By now we have a running watchdog process that
                                                  shows a window if a established connection is 
                                                  disconnected.As long the addon is executed this 
                                                  process (watchdog.sh) is executed in the background.

                                                - New parameter : AUTO-CLOSE for swtor.cfg         
 
                                                - It is now possible to quit the remote X11 Xclock 
                                                  ... You see the connection disconnected window.                                                             
                                                  This was not possible prior the watchdog process.
